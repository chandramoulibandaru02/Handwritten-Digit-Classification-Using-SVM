# Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Using-SVM
**Project: Handwritten Digit Classification Using SVM**    Built an SVM-based model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the **scikit-learn Digits dataset**. Achieved high accuracy without deep learning. Explored different kernels, visualized predictions, and plotted decision boundaries. Future plans: real-world input &amp; web deployment.
